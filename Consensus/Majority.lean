# Majority quorums

The canonical quorum system: **strict-majority** sets over a finite acceptor population.
We prove the one thing required to be a `QuorumSystem` — that any two strict-majority sets
intersect — by a counting argument: if they were disjoint their sizes would sum to at most
the population, yet each exceeds half of it. Then consensus `agreement`, `validity`, and
quorum non-emptiness apply to majority consensus for free.
