# Single-decree consensus — quorum safety

This file proves the **safety core of distributed consensus**: the property that at most
one value is ever *chosen*, which is what distinguishes consensus (the CP problem solved
by Paxos/Raft) from convergence (the AP property of CRDTs). CRDTs converge precisely by
*avoiding* consensus; here we do the opposite, and the load-bearing fact is **quorum
intersection**.

## Model

A `QuorumSystem` over an acceptor type `α` is a family of acceptor subsets (`IsQuorum`)
with the single defining axiom that **any two quorums intersect**. A run is a vote
assignment `vote : α → Option V`: each acceptor votes for at most one value (single-valued
because it is a function). A value `v` is **chosen** when some quorum has *every* member
voting `v`.

## What is proved

* `agreement` — if `v` and `v'` are both chosen, then `v = v'`. The heart of Paxos
  safety: two quorums share an acceptor, that acceptor voted a single value, so the two
  chosen values coincide.
* `quorum_nonempty` — every quorum is nonempty, falling straight out of self-intersection.
* `validity` — a chosen value was actually voted by some acceptor (no value is chosen from
  thin air).

The abstraction is deliberate: `agreement` needs *only* intersection, so it holds for
majority quorums, weighted quorums, grid quorums, or any other intersecting family. The
concrete majority instance lives in `Consensus.Majority`.
