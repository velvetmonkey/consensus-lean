# Extracted checker — a Mathlib-free, compilable, *proved* consensus gate

`Consensus.Certificate` proves the safety property over Mathlib `Finset`s, but a
Mathlib-dependent executable forces native-compiling all of Mathlib (hours). This module
is the **extracted runtime checker**: the same decision procedure over plain `List`s,
importing only `Batteries`, so it compiles to a small native binary in seconds — and it
carries its **own** agreement proof, so the gate that actually runs *is* proved Lean code,
not a hand-port pinned by tests.

The trusted base shrinks to the (fuzzable, fail-closeable) input parser; the *decision*
is machine-checked here.

/-- The runtime check, as a `Bool` over `List`s. Faithful to `Consensus.Bridge.Valid`:
duplicate-free voters that are members, form a strict majority, and each cast the claimed
value. Total and fail-closed — malformed data simply makes a conjunct false. -/

    && c.voters.all (fun a => lookup votes a == some c.value)

element: if they were disjoint, their combined length would exceed `members`. -/

/-- **Agreement, on the extracted checker.** If the `Bool` checker accepts two
certificates against the same roster and votes, they carry the same value. This is
`Consensus.Bridge.cert_agreement` re-established for the compilable `List` checker, so the
running binary is covered by a proof rather than by conformance tests alone. -/
