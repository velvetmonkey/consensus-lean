# Safe reconfiguration — agreement across changing membership

`Consensus.Quorum` proves agreement *within one fixed configuration*. But a live system's
membership and quorum rules change over time: agents join, leave, the roster rotates. The
danger is **split-brain across a reconfiguration** — two configurations whose quorums do
not overlap can each independently "choose" a different value, breaking agreement even
though each configuration is internally safe.

This file proves the condition that makes reconfiguration safe: **compatibility**, i.e.
every quorum of one configuration intersects every quorum of the other. Under
compatibility, agreement is preserved *across* the change. A `Transition` bundles two
configurations with the compatibility witness, so the seal admits a membership change only
when overlap is proven — the "constitution amendment" discipline: you may change the
guest list, but only via a process the old list overlaps and ratifies.

## Honest boundary

We model votes as a single per-acceptor assignment `vote : α → Option V` shared across
configurations — i.e. an acceptor never votes for two different values, *across epochs
included*. That single-vote discipline is exactly what a real reconfiguration protocol
(Vertical Paxos, Raft joint-consensus) must *enforce over time* by carrying chosen values
forward; here it is assumed, not derived. What is certified is the structural heart:
**compatible configurations cannot disagree.** Transitive safety across a long history
still requires either all-pairs compatibility (proved here) or per-step value
carry-forward (the protocol layer, not modelled).

/-- **Cross-configuration agreement.** If `v` is chosen in configuration `c` and `v'` in a
compatible configuration `d` (under the same single-vote-per-acceptor assignment), then
`v = v'`. A shared acceptor exists by compatibility; its vote is one value; so the two
chosen values coincide. Reconfiguration preserves agreement exactly when the
configurations are compatible. -/

arbitrarily many times without ever admitting two conflicting decisions, provided every
pair of configurations overlaps. -/
